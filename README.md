# Starbucks-Coffee-Website-Landing-Page

Step 1 (HTML Code):
To get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our Starbucks coffee website landing page.

Step 2 (CSS Code):
Once the basic HTML structure of the Starbucks landing page is in place, the next step is to add styling to the Starbucks landing page using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.
